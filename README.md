[Twitch VOD Sync](https://twitch-vod-sync.github.io/twitch-vod-sync.github.io)
==============================================================

This is a web application that can show multiple recorded videos from Twitch, syncing them exactly.

If you want to see the streams of multiple people playing together, applications like [MultiTwitch.tv](http://www.multitwitch.tv/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/bhamrick/multitwitch)) or Twitch's own "Squad Stream" mode can help. However if you are watching the streams after the fact (or after the event) or if the streams are not exactly synced (because they use different delays, common in competitions) it won't work.

This application can bring up multiple VOD (recorded streams), obtain their starting date from the API, and show them in perfect sync. You will still need to input the appropriate delay for each stream if different.

Current status
--------------

This project is a fork of [the original](https://github.com/remram44/twitch-vod-sync) from remram44, where I (jbzdarkid) can do a bit of extended development. The project is mostly feature-complete -- just a few tweaks and additions, as I see/want them.
I'll probably try to tackle some of the [issues](https://github.com/remram44/twitch-vod-sync/issues) from the original project; feel free to leave feedback here, though.
